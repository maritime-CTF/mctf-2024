									<h2>What is the Maritime Capture the Flag Competition?</h2>
									<p> The competition is hosted by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and will be advertised via <a href="https://www.challenge.gov/">Challenge.gov</a> 
									<p>The Maritime Capture the Flag Competition <strong>(MCTF)</strong> invites submissions of AI agents that can autonomously play a multi-player Capture-the-Flag game within a maritime, multi-agent, real-time game environment. Participants are required to submit software code for two agents that can play the game as a team while maximizing their team's score. Submissions must use the submission format given <a href="submission.html">here</a>, in order to be considered as a valid entry.</p>

									<h2>Previous Competitions</h2>
									<a href="#"><img src="images/jervis23_635.jpg" alt="" class="top blog-post-image" /></a>
									<p>We have internally within the leadership team held  maritime capture the flag competitions over the past three years. The first two we spent investigating the 1v1 scenario, and deploying our algorithms on WestPoint's hardware robots courtesey of Misha Novitzsky. In 2023 the pyquaticus simulator was developed at MIT Lincoln Labs which allows for more effective multiagent trainng allowing us to look at the more complex 2v2 scenario where we deployed on physical robots in Jervis bay Australia. We have also held internal competitions at the Naval Research Laboratory between interns.</p>
