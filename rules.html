									<h2>Competition Description</h2>
									
									<p>Capture the Flag is a commonly-played team-game involving two opposing teams playing within a bounded playing field. The field is divided into two halves, one for each team; each team has a flag located inside their respective half. The objective of each team is to score points by capturing the opponent’s' flag, while not accruing negative points by preventing its own flag from being captured by the opponent’s team. The game ends after a certain, pre-determined duration. In this challenge, we consider a Maritime Capture-the-Flag (MCTF) game where the players are autonomous marine vehicles. The main features and events in the MCTF game are described below:</p>
									<h2> Playing Field </h2>
									<p>A rectanglular area measuring 160-meters by 80-meters and divided into two, 80-meter halves, one for each team.</p>
									<img src="./images/game_field.jpg" width="450">
									<h2> Home Base </h2>
									<p>The home base of a team is a 10-meter diameter circular area inside the team's half which contains the team's flag at its center.</p>
									<img src="./images/home_base_visual.png" width="450">
									<h2> Tag </h2>
									<p>A player can get tagged in two ways:</p>
										<p>&emsp;&#x2022; If it is in its opponent's half and within 10-meters of an opponent player.</p>
										<video width="450" controls>
											<source src="./videos/tag.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p>&emsp;&#x2022; If it goes outside of the boundary of the playing field.</p>
										<video width="450" controls>
											<source src="./videos/oob_tag.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p></p>
									<h2> Flag Grab </h2>
									<p>A flag grab occurs when a player enters its opponent team’s home base in an untagged state, and the opponent’s flag is still at the home base. </p>
									<video width="450" controls>
											<source src="./videos/flag_grab.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p></p>
									<h2> Flag Capture </h2>
									<p>A flag capture occurs when a player returns to its home base after grabbing its has an opponent’s flag.</p>
									<video width="450" controls>
											<source src="./videos/opponent_flag_capture.mp4" type="video/mp4">
										</video>
										<p></p>
									<h2> Untagging </h2>
									<p>A player that has been tagged (either by an opponent or by going out of bounds) can get untagged by returning to its team’s home base. Players that are in a tagged state, are not able to tag opponents, grab or capture the opponent’s flag. If a player gets tagged the game arbitrator will automatically take over the agents controls and drive it back to their teams home base.</p>
									
									<h2> Game Duration </h2>
									<p>Each game will last for a total of 10 minutes</p>

									<h2> Score Calculations </h2>
									<p>Each game will last for a total of 10 minutes</p>
									<p>&emsp;1. Primary Score = Number_of_Team_Flag_Captures - Number_of_Opponent_Flag_Captures - Number_of_Team_Collisions</p>
									<p>&emsp;2. If there is a tie on the primary score, then the following score is used for tie breaking: (Number_of_Team_Flag_Grabs + Number_of_Team_Tags) - (Number_of_Opponent_Flag_Grabs + Number_of_opponent_Tags).</p>
